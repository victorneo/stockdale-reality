# Introduction

This project provides a simple interface that will allow you to build a simple
"dashboard" for any sort of metric tracking that you need (but you'll need to
write the code for it).

The purpose is to always have these metrics in a place that will be highly
visible and one that you must always confront.

## Background

While web-based dashboard solutions exist for us to track metrics, there are
several types of metrics that would require programming to be able to generate
or populate, such as custom metrics on Github projects.

You might be writing custom scripts for each of them today and tracking them in
various ways; this project aims to be a "scripting" interface that allows you to
centralize the scripting and have them all report to you in one single place.

## Requirements

Python 3.7+ is required as asyncio received a significant performance boost in 3.7+.
